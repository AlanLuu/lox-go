## Mathematical functions and constants

Unless specified otherwise, all arguments to mathematical functions are numbers.

The following mathematical functions and constants are defined in the built-in `Math` class:
- `Math.abs(num)`, which returns the absolute value of `num`
- `Math.acos(num)`, which returns the inverse cosine in radians of `num`
- `Math.acosh(num)`, which returns the inverse hyperbolic cosine of `num`
- `Math.asin(num)`, which returns the inverse sine in radians of `num`
- `Math.asinh(num)`, which returns the inverse hyperbolic sine of `num`
- `Math.atan(num)`, which returns the inverse tangent in radians of `num`
- `Math.atan2(y, x)`, which returns the inverse tangent of `y / x`, where `y` and `x` are in radians
- `Math.atanh(num)`, which returns the inverse hyperbolic tangent of `num`
- `Math.cbrt(num)`, which returns the cube root of `num`
- `Math.ceil(num)`, which returns the smallest whole number greater than or equal to `num`
- `Math.cos(num)`, which returns the cosine of `num`, where `num` is in radians
- `Math.cosh(num)`, which returns the hyperbolic cosine of `num`
- `Math.E`, which is the value of Euler's number `e`, approximately `2.71828`
- `Math.exp(num)`, which returns the value of `e` raised to the power of `num`
- `Math.floor(num)`, which returns the largest whole number less than or equal to `num`
- `Math.hypot(x, y)`, which returns the square root of `(x ** 2) + (y ** 2)`, where `**` is the exponentiation operator
- `Math.log(num)`, which returns the natural logarithm of `num`

- `Math.min(x, y)`, which returns the smallest of `x` and `y`
- `Math.nthrt(num, n)`, which returns the `n`th root of `num`
- `Math.PI`, which is the value of pi, approximately `3.14159`
- `Math.random()`, which returns a random decimal number between `0` and `1` exclusive
- `Math.round(num)`, which returns `num` rounded to the nearest whole number
- `Math.sin(num)`, which returns the sine of `num`, where `num` is in radians
