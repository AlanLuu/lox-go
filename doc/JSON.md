## JSON methods

The following methods are defined in the built-in `JSON` class:
- `JSON.parse(str)`, which attempts to parse a JSON string representation into a dictionary, throwing any parsing errors encountered during the parsing as runtime errors
- `JSON.stringify(arg)`, which attempts to convert the specified argument into a JSON string representation, throwing a runtime error if the argument cannot be converted into one
