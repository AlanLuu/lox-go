# Dotenv methods

Any method that fails will throw a runtime error with a message describing the error.

The following methods are defined in the built-in `dotenv` class:
- `dotenv.dictToEnv(envDict)`, which returns a string of the parsed contents from the specified dictionary in env format
    - The dictionary keys and values must only be strings or else a runtime error is thrown
    - The dictionary cannot have a key that is an empty string or else a runtime error is thrown
    - The dictionary cannot have a key that contains an `=` character or else a runtime error is thrown
- `dotenv.dictToEnvBuf(envDict)`, which returns a buffer of the parsed contents from the specified dictionary in env format
    - The dictionary keys and values must only be strings or else a runtime error is thrown
    - The dictionary cannot have a key that is an empty string or else a runtime error is thrown
    - The dictionary cannot have a key that contains an `=` character or else a runtime error is thrown
- `dotenv.dictToEnvFile(envDict, [file/string])`, which takes in a dictionary in env format and an optional file object or string and writes the parsed contents from the specified dictionary to the specified file object or the file specified by the path string
    - If a string is passed as the second argument and the file already exists, it is truncated
    - The dictionary keys and values must only be strings or else a runtime error is thrown
    - The dictionary cannot have a key that is an empty string or else a runtime error is thrown
    - The dictionary cannot have a key that contains an `=` character or else a runtime error is thrown
- `dotenv.dictToEnvFileNoNewlineEnd(envDict, [file/string])`, which takes in a dictionary in env format and an optional file object or string and writes the parsed contents from the specified dictionary without a newline character at the end to the specified file object or the file specified by the path string
    - If a string is passed as the second argument and the file already exists, it is truncated
    - The dictionary keys and values must only be strings or else a runtime error is thrown

- `dotenv.exec(filenames, cmd, cmdArgs, isOverload)`, which executes the command string, `cmd`, after loading environment variables from `filenames`, which is a list of strings of paths to env files, along with the command line arguments, `cmdArgs`, which is a list of strings, and `isOverload`, which is a boolean that overrides any existing environment variables when set to `true`
    - The `filenames` and `cmdArgs` lists must only have strings or else a runtime error is thrown
- `dotenv.load([filenames...])`, which loads the env files specified by the file name strings into the current process
    - All arguments must be strings or else a runtime error is thrown
    - If no arguments are specified, this method looks for a file named `.env` in the current working directory and loads the environment variables from that file
    - A runtime error is thrown if something goes wrong in loading the environment variables
- `dotenv.new([buffer/dict/string])`, which returns a new dotenv object from the specified buffer, dictionary, or string representation of an env file
    - If the argument to this method is omitted, this method returns a blank dotenv object
    - The dictionary keys and values must only be strings or else a runtime error is thrown

    - All arguments must be strings or else a runtime error is thrown
    - If no arguments are specified, this method looks for a file named `.env` in the current working directory and loads the environment variables from that file
    - A runtime error is thrown if something goes wrong in loading the environment variables
- `dotenv.parse(buffer/string)`, which takes in a string or buffer representation of an env file and returns a dictionary of the contents

    - All arguments must be strings or else a runtime error is thrown
    - If no arguments are specified, this method looks for a file named `.env` in the current working directory and loads the environment variables from that file
